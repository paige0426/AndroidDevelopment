 * Utilized another web application backend (https://github.com/paige0426/Dashi) as server;
 * Integrated with Google Map API to display restaurant’s location in Google map view;
 * Enhanced UI’s interactivity by using multiple fragments, animations, drawer layouts, views and customized adapters;
 * Implemented asynchronous methods to process HTTP request and response with server through RESTful API.
